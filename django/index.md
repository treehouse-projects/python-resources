### Django Web Framework
Django is a free and open-source web framework used by many popular sites. It is maintained by a non-profit organization called the Django Software Foundation. Django is written in Python and just like Python is "batteries-included", meaning many other contributions have been made to this framework in the form of packages so that you can quickly plugin extra pieces of functionality into your project.
