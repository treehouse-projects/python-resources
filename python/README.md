## [Python](https://www.python.org/)
Python is a high-level **general purpose**, dynamically typed, object-orientated, _interpreted_ programming language.

### Terminology

**General Purpose**

  >Can be used for many different purposes.

**Dynamically Typed**

  >Will "type check" at runtime, so you do not have to specify the type of data something will be before setting it.

**Object Orientated**

  >Is just a style and/or pattern of programming that allows you to bundle up your related pieces of code into _objects_. Objects can hold their state in memory and can inherit other objects functionality which means you can create reusable pieces of code which can help keep your code organized and clean.

**Interpreted**

  >This just means the translation of the code you write is not pre-compiled before you try to run it. It is "interpreted" line by line on-the-fly. This allows you to write and execute code more quickly, but also can be a drawback, where a compiler would of normally errored because it checks all lines prior to running them.

### Style Guides
Style Guides are just guidelines, but they are quite important when you start working in teams or others need to read the code you have written. They are great to use in practice to help you to write clean/organized code.

### [Python Environments](#) (Work in progress)
You will hear about making "virtual environments" or "isolated Python environments" nearly everywhere when working in Python. It is a common practice that you will use to "isolate" dependencies for a given project.
